### Overview

This is work for my 2025 NCEA Level 1 DIGITECH class.\
Completion of this version of the website has taken approximately 30 days. After complications with the GitHub Desktop, a new repository was made, which solved the issues I was recieving.

### Project Details

This is an open source website designed for my software development business. This website is designed to display as much information as possible about the services we provide whilst also having a smooth and streamlined design, easily understandable.
